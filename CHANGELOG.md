## [0.3.1] - Architecture Stabilization & Query Reliability

### Added
- Unit tests covering core query intelligence components
  - query detection
  - filter expression rules
  - filter value validation
  - choice metadata interpretation
- Validation safeguards for `$filter` value formatting across string, numeric, datetime, and lookup fields
- Shared utilities for query mutation and filter construction
- Additional internal diagnostics coverage for metadata interpretation logic

### Improved
- Refactored metadata architecture separating **metadata loading** from **value interpretation**
- Centralized metadata retrieval and caching through `metadataAccess`
- Introduced pure interpretation layer `valueAwareness` for choice metadata resolution
- Reduced duplication across query mutation actions using a shared mutation runner
- Improved field picker experience by hiding non-selectable fields
- Improved string escaping for OData filter expressions
- Improved handling of numeric, GUID, and datetime filter values
- Improved testability of core query analysis components

### Fixed
- Incorrect quoting behavior for datetime filter expressions
- Duplicate query detection logic across mutation actions
- Edge cases where non-selectable metadata fields appeared in `$select` field pickers
- Several internal metadata interpretation inconsistencies

## [0.3.0] - Environment Profiles & Safe Multi-Environment Metadata

### Added
- Environment profile system supporting multiple Dataverse environments
- First-run environment setup wizard
- Commands to add, select, and remove environments
- Status bar indicator showing the active Dataverse environment
- Configurable environment status colors (white / amber / red)
- Environment-aware metadata diagnostics showing active environment and cache prefix

### Improved
- Persisted metadata caches are now scoped per environment
- Metadata diagnostics clearly show which environment cache is being inspected
- Cache keys normalized using environment prefix to prevent cross-environment reuse
- Prevented metadata leakage between environments when switching contexts
- Cleared session metadata caches automatically when environment changes
- Cleared hover and navigation enrichment caches during environment switch
- Persisted cache clear command now clears caches for the active environment only

## [0.2.2] - Performance & Cache Observability

### Added
- Metadata diagnostics command to inspect runtime cache state
- Commands to clear session metadata cache
- Commands to clear persisted metadata cache
- Versioned metadata cache keys to support safe future upgrades

### Improved

- Reduced repeated metadata resolution during hover and Smart GET workflows
- Optimized CodeLens refresh behavior to avoid unnecessary recomputation while editing
- Improved metadata cache reuse across hover and query analysis features
- Reduced output noise by demoting non-critical logs to debug level
- Added lightweight entity-definition prewarm to improve first-use responsiveness

### Fixed

- Persisted metadata cache invalidation for entity definitions
- Duplicate hover request context property causing redundant lookup paths
- Cache key inconsistencies across metadata caches

## [0.2.1] - Hotfix

### Fixed
- Improved Azure CLI discovery across Windows environments
